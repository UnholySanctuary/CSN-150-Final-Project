# CSN-150-Final-Project

I used the following documentation

*Allow2*
[Github markdown] (https://allow2.github.io/)

## Summary

Name: Allow2 Parental Freedom Platform

Description: I am interested in this software because I believe it will better enforce protecting my children from sites, links, and videos that my children are not supposed to have access to. Main reason for me searching for something like this in the first place is because despite me using YouTube’s parental control features my son was still able to watch videos inappropriate for a 6-year-old.

## Steps
1. Searched parental control software on Google and clicked on the Allow2 link.
2. Navigated the home page and clicked on the try it link.
3. Watched the introductory video at the top of the page.

4. Clicked on the “Start Using Allow2” button at the bottom of the page.
5. Created an account.
6. Followed the prompts to add my child and then set restrictions and timers.
7. There is also a calendar to further customize the experience.

## Conclusion

From the video demonstration I can link different apps and devices to the Allow2. The free option allows for setting up Parental Controls for 1 child across multiple devices and there are three different subscriptions services with increasing perks the higher you go. I can select the day type and what is allowed on said day such as a sick day, holiday, and school day. There is an allow times tab to set up the length of time a device and app could be used, and overall I like the look, format, and options provided by this. It definitely feels like it is the extra layer of protection I have  been looking to add to my children’s devices. There is also an option for my child to send requests for more time or to download something which is also a plus.
